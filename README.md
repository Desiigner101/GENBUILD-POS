# Retail Billing Software 🛒

Welcome to my Retail Billing Software project!
This project is a humble step in my journey as a student developer. It’s inspired by my recent mobile app project GenBuild, where I sell computer parts mainly used by gamers. While GenBuild was all about PC enthusiasts, this new project aims to expand that idea into a general retail billing system, something more versatile and practical.

# Why I’m Building This 🌱

As a student, I’m constantly looking for ways to grow and explore new fields in software development. This project is my first ever Point of Sale (POS) system, and it’s not about perfection but about learning.

I’ve been scattering around the internet, reading guides, and piecing things together just to understand how such systems work. More than anything, this is a passion project a personal milestone that blends my curiosity, previous works, and design inspirations.

# Design Inspiration 🎨

This project takes a lot of its styling and palettes from a Figma design project I worked on last semester. I believe design isn’t just about looks—it’s about creating something functional, comfortable, and meaningful to use. That’s the spirit I’m carrying into this project.

# Tech Stack ⚙️

Frontend: React + Vite

Backend: Spring Boot 

Database & Tools: 
- **MySQL** – Relational database used for data storage and management.  
- **XAMPP** – Local development environment for running MySQL and Apache.  
- **Axios** – Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.  
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)** – Abstraction for database operations in Java.  
- **Lombok** – Reduces boilerplate code in Java (e.g., getters, setters, constructors).
- **React Router DOM** – Declarative routing for React applications.   

Styling: 
- **Bootstrap CSS** – Frontend framework for responsive design and styling.  

This setup is challenging for me, but I believe it’s the right way to push myself into full-stack development.

# What This Means to Me ✨

This Retail Billing Software represents:

My growth as a developer.

My curiosity to explore POS systems.

My dedication to learning, even if it means struggling through new concepts.

A bridge from GenBuild and my Figma projects to something more practical and real-world oriented.


This is more than just a project—it’s a journey of learning and persistence. I’m not chasing perfection here. Instead, I’m chasing improvement, one line of code at a time.

If you’re reading this, thank you for taking the time to check out my work. Your support means a lot in this small but meaningful step in my career as a student developer.



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
